Mission Pinball Framework Examples
==================================

<img align="right" height="200" src="mpf-examples-logo.png"/>

This GitHub repository contains example configuration, demos, and tutorial files for the Mission Pinball Framework. It's
a separate repo from the main MPF project so you can download this folder to an easily-accessible location.

The examples here are synchronized to work with the corresponding branches in MPF and the MPF-MC. (e.g. the "master"
branch of mpf-examples works with the master branch of mpf, the dev branch works with the dev branch, etc.)

If you're new to MPF, start with the tutorial at http://docs.missionpinball.org/en/latest/tutorial/.

More details about MPF are here: https://missionpinball.org.

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/missionpinball/mpf-examples/badge.svg?branch=dev&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/missionpinball/mpf-examples?branch=dev)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/missionpinball/mpf-examples.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/missionpinball/mpf-examples)

Note that the branch of this repo corresponds to the branch of MPF. (e.g. the 'master' branch of examples here should
work with the master branch of MPF, the dev with the dev, etc.)
